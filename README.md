# zaio-git-netflix
This is clone of the original Netflix landing page , this my second project as a web developer.
In this project we used some advanced css.My page consists of 3 sections and is not a exact clone of the original Netflix page(it has more sections). 
I do however plan on adding the other sections to my clone.
The aim for this project was to go deeper into css , learning about 'selectors' (elements,IDs,classes,universal selectors,css comments;pseudo selectors etc)
This project was mainly focussed on educating us more on css.
